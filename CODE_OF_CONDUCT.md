# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the AI Threat Hunting Simulator community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing cybersecurity education and threat detection capabilities.

## Ethical Use Policy

## Security Researcher Responsibilities

As a community focused on cybersecurity, we hold ourselves to high ethical standards:

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Do** email security details to the maintainers privately
3. **Do** allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
4. **Do** work collaboratively with maintainers to address the issue

### Scenario Development Ethics

When creating attack scenarios:

1. **Base on real-world, publicly-documented attacks** - Don't create novel 0-days
2. **Use synthetic data only** - Never include real credentials, IPs, or PII
3. **Mark dangerous patterns clearly** - Help users understand risks
4. **Provide defensive context** - Explain how to detect and prevent each attack
5. **Follow responsible disclosure** - If based on recent vulnerabilities, ensure patches exist

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Email communications with maintainers
- Social media when representing the project
- Community events (virtual or in-person)
- Any other official project channels

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, such as:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at events
- Presenting about the project at conferences or meetups

## Enforcement

### Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, unethical, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** [security@project-domain.com]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames) of individuals involved
- Description of the incident
- Approximate date/time
- Any relevant links, screenshots, or evidence
- Any additional context

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or unethical use of project resources.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including:
- Sustained inappropriate behavior
- Harassment of individuals
- Malicious or unethical use of project resources
- Violation of ethical use policies

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. Contributions may be removed or attributed appropriately.

### Escalation Path

1. **Minor Issues**: Handled by maintainers with a warning
2. **Moderate Issues**: Temporary restrictions or bans
3. **Severe Issues**: Immediate permanent ban + potential legal action for criminal behavior
4. **Ethical Violations**: Immediate removal + notification to appropriate authorities if applicable
